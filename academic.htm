			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The school that I'm currently attending is <a href="https://www.lisd.net/">Lewisville High School</a>.
			It's a good school with lots of courses that can be taken and along with that I would have to say that
			my favorite subjects would be either something with science or math. This is just cause I have a very
			bad memory so it hinders my capabilities for retaining information in history and as for my english course 
			- I just suck at english. This doesn't mean that I hate those classes, just that it's a lot more challenging
			for me and I'm lazy so I don't like the work. With my current classes, I have a multitude of projects and
			homework to accomplish on an everyday basis. Some of the upcoming projects include: learning java
			for Computer Programming, some more history/reason for Fashion Marketing, and a lot more labs for Physics.
